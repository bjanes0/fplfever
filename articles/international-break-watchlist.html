          Tammy Abraham has found the net 4 times in his last 2 matches

        <p>
          After an exciting 4 weeks, the first international break of the
          Premier League season is finally among us. With many managers
          contemplating different changes to their sides, let&rsquo;s examine 5
          options who could make your team in the near future.
        </p>
        <p><strong>1. Tammy Abraham</strong></p>
        <p>
          Despite Chelsea&rsquo;s slow start to the season, picking up only 5
          points and 1 win from their matches so far, Abraham has been one of
          the bright spots, bagging 2 braces in his last 2 matches. Looking to
          beat out the competition for Chelsea&rsquo;s starting striker, it
          seems certain that Abraham has secured his place for now as
          Chelsea&rsquo;s #1.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, he has 2 tricky fixtures, one away to Wolves and
          one hosting Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, before facing an easier run
          of fixtures that includes Brighton and Newcastle at home. So far,
          Abraham&rsquo;s attacking statistics seem promising, as he has managed
          to get off 2.8 shots per game and make 2.1 key passes per game. If
          Abraham can continue his run of form into Chelsea&rsquo;s easier
          fixtures, he can undoubtably repay mangers bold enough to take a risk
          on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verdict: </strong>Worth picking up after GW6 as long as he
          continues to start every match.
        </p>

          <p class="article-img-caption text-muted text-center">
            Todd Cantwell has started all 4 matches for Norwich this season
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>2. Todd Cantwell</strong></p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest surprises of the season so far, Cantwell is
          undoubtably one of the best budget players so far this season.
          Originally priced at only 4.5, and now priced at 4.8, Cantwell and
          teammate Teemu Pukki have helped Norwich get off to a positive start
          after their return to the Premier League. Although Norwich had
          difficult fixtures against Liverpool and Chelsea, they have managed to
          score in 3 of their first 4 games. Cantwell so far has found one goal
          and 2 assists, and has shown promise in many of his stats such as his
          average of 2 key passes per game and 1 shot per game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Cantwell won&rsquo;t bring in double digit points every week,
          he is still one to watch due to his low price point.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verdict: </strong>Worth picking up due to his great value and
          attacking prospects.
        </p>
        <div class="article-img text-center">

          <p class="article-img-caption text-muted text-center">
            Aubameyang has found points in each of his first 4 matches
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>3. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</strong></p>
        <p>
          Auba is off to a reasonable start this season after finding returns in
          each of his first 4 matches. Despite this, he is yet to register
          double digit points, but he may be set to do so with a good run of
          upcoming fixtures. Between gameweek 5 and gameweek 16, Aubameyang
          faces just 1 top 6 side, Manchester United, in gameweek 7. Over this
          period, Auba could find a large portion of his points for this season,
          especially considering he looks to be a better option than Harry Kane,
          who is priced similarly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, many of the top players this season so far have been
          midfielders, and no strikers have emerged as must-owns thus far. With
          his good run of opponents, Auba could become the standout option
          before his fixtures turn for the worse near the festive period.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verdict: </strong>A risky gamble, but one that can pay off.

            Dan James has found his way into the Manchester United XI
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>4. Dan James</strong></p>
        <p>
          Another breakout star so far this season is Daniel James. Acquired
          from Swansea City for $15 million, James has scored 3 times so far
          this season, and has been one of the bright spots in a defunct
          Manchester United XI. James has been creating the space to shoot from
          the wing, as he has averaged 2.8 shots per game so far. With Martial
          and Rashford yet to make a large impact as goalscorers, James could
          emerge as United&rsquo;s main man this season. Considering his price
          is only 6.1, it could be worth the risk to bring him in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite all the promise, it is possible his goalscoring may slow down
          significantly. While playing for Swansea, James found the net just 4
          times in 33 appearances for the club. Manchester United also have some
          tricky fixtures in their next 5, with matches against Leicester,
          Arsenal, and Liverpool.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verdict: </strong>Continue watching for now, consider after
          GW9.
        </p>
        <div class="article-img text-center">

            Jamie Vardy has scored the 3rd most goals in 2019
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>5. Jamie Vardy</strong></p>
        <p>
          Once again, Vardy has proved himself a fantasy option once again this
          season after picking up 3 goals and an assist in the first 4 matches
          of the season. Vardy has already proven his ability to excel in the
          Premier League, as he has found over 150 points in each of his last 4
          seasons. So far, he has found returns in his 2 easier matches, but
          blanked in his more difficult 2. Since the start of 2019, Vardy has
          scored 15 times, making him one of the top scorers in the Premier
          League this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vardy has benefitted from Leicester&rsquo;s change in management, as
          his improved record coincides with Brendan Rogers&rsquo; appointment.
          In addition, new teammate Youri Tielmans has proved his potential to
          assist and improve Leicester&rsquo;s creativity in attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verdict: </strong>Consider bringing in GW 6 after matches vs.
          Manchester United and Tottenham.
