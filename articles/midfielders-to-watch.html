          This year we have been given a large number of FPL midfield options
          from various pricepoints; here are a couple that may not start in your
          team, but are worth keeping an eye on throughout the early stages of
          the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ayoze Perez (6.5) </strong>looks set to be a top mid-priced
          option this season following his transfers from Newcastle United to
          Leicester. Playing out of position as a forward or winger, Perez will
          be enthusiastic to join up with a fiery Leicester attack who managed
          17 goals following Rogers first match in March. In addition, Perez
          scored 8 for Newcastle in the 899 minutes he played since Roger's
          takeover at Leicester. Leicester will be enthusiastic for a solid
          start to the season despite facing 4 of the top 6 in their first 10
          matches. Perez, who scored 12 of Newcastle's 42 goals last season is
          already off to a solid start in preseason, scoring in Leicester's 1-0
          victory versus Scunthorpe on the 16<sup>th</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Wilfried Zaha (7.0) </strong>is another player many managers
          will be keen on placing in their teams, with the Crystal Palace man
          currently in 29.2% of teams. He will be looking to carry the momentum
          from the end of last season after finding 7 of his 10 goals after the
          new year. However, Palace faces looming defensive issues after losing
          <strong>Aaron Wan-Bissaka (5.5)</strong> to Manchester United and
          injuries to <strong>Mamadou Sakho (5.0)</strong> and
          <strong>James Tomkins (5.0)</strong> could see their results take a
          downward turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another player worth watching is <strong>Kevin de Bruyne</strong>
          <strong>(9.5)</strong>. Available at a discounted price this year
          following an injury ridden campaign last season, de Bruyne will be
          looking to continue his form he found late last season before picking
          up another small injury that left him out the final few weeks. With
          965 minutes under his belt last season, de Bruyne found a league high
          .62 xA/90. If he can carry that momentum into this season, he could be
          a great option at his mid-high pricepoint.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chelsea midfielders <strong>Pedro (7.0)</strong>,
          <strong>Willian (7.0)</strong> and new signing
          <strong>Pulisic (7.5)</strong> all make the list as it is currently
          unclear who will emerge to fill the gap left behind by the departure
          of Eden Hazard. Pedro found the net far more times than Willian, with
          8 goals to Willian's 3, however, Willian's 7 assists topped Pedro's 2.
          Pulisic on the other hand found the net 4 times and assisted 4 times
          in 20 appearances for Dortmund last season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gylfi Sigurdsson</strong> <strong>(8.0)</strong> will be
          looking to lead Everton's attack this season after recording the 4<sup
            >th</sup
          >
          most points for all midfielders with 13 goals and 8 assists.
          Sigurdsson has the benefit of being on penalty duty once again for the
          upcoming season, and flanked by<strong> Richarlison (8.0) </strong>and
          <strong>Theo Walcott (6.5)</strong> as well as an improved
          <strong>Domenic Calvert-Lewin (6.0)</strong>, Sigurdsson will hope his
          teammates will provide the support he needs to keep the points flowing
          this season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced at a modest 7.5, <strong>David Silva (7.5)</strong> could find
          his way into many teams this season. The Spanish playmaker will be
          sure to retain his minutes despite City's many signings, and with his
          lower pricepoint, he could be a simple option to get invested in the
          Manchester City attack. After racking up 143 points last season and
          missing only 5 matches, Silva will be looking to add onto his 6 goals
          and 8 assists last season.
