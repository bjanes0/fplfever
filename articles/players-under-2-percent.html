        <p>
          <strong><u>Goakeepers</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Angus Gunn (owned by 1.5%, 4.5)</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After emerging as the first-choice keeper for Southampton last season,
          Gunn looks set to retain his place in net, despite being owned by a
          small fraction of players. Following Ralph Hasenh&uuml;ttl&rsquo;s
          appointment in December, Southampton managed to avoid relegation and
          show massive signs of improvement. One of the changes by the Austrian
          manager was placing Gunn in goal who kept a clean sheet vs. Chelsea in
          his first appearance of the season. In the following weeks he became
          the first-choice goalkeeper, keeping 2 clean sheets in the following
          11 matches he started. Gunn could also be a good pick while still
          feeling out the new season, as he faces Burnley, Brighton, and
          Sheffield all away in the first 5 matches of the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            ><u>Ralf F&auml;hrmann (owned by 0.8%, 4.5) &ndash;</u></strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          New signing F&auml;hrmann will be ambitious to beat the competition
          and become the first choice for Norwich this season. Despite being
          relegation favorites, we have seen in the past goalkeepers for poor
          defenses managing high points totals, such as Neil Etheridge&rsquo;s
          high points total last season. Norwich managed 13 clean sheets in
          their 46 Championship matches last season and have managed to retain
          their top defenders. Despite some tricky matches in his first 5,
          facing Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester City, F&auml;hrmann could
          find plenty of save points and emerge the top 4.5 goalkeeper this
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Defenders</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Serge Aurier (owned by 1.4%, 5.0) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the surprising transfer of Kieran Trippier to Atletico
          Madrid, Aurier could be set to start the season at right back for
          Spurs. At just 5.0, he would be the cheapest starter in the Tottenham
          defense who managed 13 clean sheets last season, the 5<sup>th</sup>
          most in the league. Despite this, he could face rotation with Kyle
          Walker-Pieters due to Spurs&rsquo; involvement in the Champions
          League.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            ><u>Jack O&rsquo;Connell (owned by 0.8%, 4.5) &ndash;</u></strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Although being at just 0.8% ownership, O&rsquo;Connell could be the
          best option from the Sheffield United defense. Sheffield was
          undoubtably the best defense in the Championship last season, as they
          managed a league high 21 clean sheets. O&rsquo;Connell managed a
          significant offensive contribution as well, with 3 goals and 3
          assists. Priced at only 4.5, rather than 5.0, O&rsquo;Connell could be
          one of the top 4.5 defenders this season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Ben Johnson (owned by 1.2%, 4.0) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnson, the 19 year old right back, has shown a large amount of
          promise in pre-season and has been handed numerous starts by Hammers
          manager Manuel Pellegrini. With several impressive performances under
          his belt already, Johnson could nail down a starting spot in the West
          Ham starting XI. At just 4.0, the cheapest price for a defender, he
          could find his way into many top teams if he becomes a starter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Jan Bednarek (owned by 1.2%, 4.5) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Gunn, Bednarek is a staple of the Southampton defense that showed
          so much promise at the conclusion of last season. Bednarek, despite
          earning just 3 bonus points, will be Southampton&rsquo;s best outfield
          option due to his threat from set pieces and his promise shown in the
          bonus point system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Matthew Lowton (owned by 0.3%, 4.5) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rounding out the defenders is Burnley right back Matthew Lowton.
          Lowton should be set to start at right back once again this season
          following some trouble with injuries in the past. Lowton has shown his
          ability to earn FPL points in the past as well as his attacking
          potential as he earned 89 points and 3 assists in just about 2300
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Midfielders</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Bernard (owned by 0.5%, 6.5) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Bernard will be hopeful to have a better second season in the Premier
          League following his first year with Everton. Last season, he showed
          hints of promise but generally failed to find his stride in attack
          with only 1 goal and 3 assists. He could still be a viable option, as
          Everton have extremely favorable early fixtures. With only 2 matches
          vs the top 6 in their first 14 fixtures of the season, Bernard could
          find plenty of points early in the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Mason Mount (owned by 0.5%, 6.0) &ndash; </u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Chelsea youngster Mason Mount could feature heavily this season for
          Chelsea and shows a lot of promise as a fantasy option priced at just
          6.0. Following a successful loan spell to Vitesse in 2017 where he
          scored 9 goals in 29 appearances and a spell at Derby where he found
          the net 8 times in 35 matches. Having just signed a new long term
          contract July 15<sup>th</sup>, it is clear Mount will be in
          Lampard&rsquo;s plans and could be a points machine if he gets the
          playing time he deserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Leandro Trossard (owned by 0.5%, 6.0) &ndash; </u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another exciting new signing this new season is Leandro Trossard who
          will be looking to enhance Brighton&rsquo;s attack. Trossard, who
          managed 14 goals and 7 assists while playing for Genk last season, is
          an exciting option considering he is priced at only 6.0. Although
          Brighton struggled last season, particularly in attack, Trossard could
          take set pieces for Brighton which could lead to a surplus of assist
          points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            ><u>Andriy Yarmolenko (owned by 0.4%, 6.0) &ndash; </u></strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending the majority of the last season injured, Yarmolenko
          will be keen on finding his way back into West Ham&rsquo;s attack.
          Yarmolenko proved his ability to succeed last season with 2 goals
          early in the season but was ruled out for the remainder of the year.
          After the signing of Pablo Fornals, Yarmolenko could see his points
          ceiling heightened
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Pascal Gross (owned by 0.8%, 6.5) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The final midfielder in the team is Pascal Gross, Brighton&rsquo;s
          main man in attack. Gross struggled with fitness last season and it
          was apparent in his attacking return, as he only managed 3 goals and 3
          assists in 1864 minutes. Despite this, Gross has proved his ability in
          the Premier League before as he managed 164 points in the 17/18
          season. After some solid performances near the end of last season,
          Gross could be one to watch at the start of this season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Forwards</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Billy Sharp (owned by 1.8%, 6.0) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sheffield United talisman Billy Sharp has been priced at a relatively
          low 6.0 this season after finding 23 goals and 4 assists in the
          Championship last season. Despite this, Sharp has only been selected
          by 1.8% of players this season. Sheffield are poised to retain their
          place in the Premier League this season, and Sharp could be key to
          their success.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Tammy Abraham (owned by 1.4%, 7.0) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tammy Abraham is the second Chelsea player to make the list, and one
          of the contenders to be Chelsea&rsquo;s starting striker this season.
          Abraham found the net 25 times last season in the Championship while
          on loan from Chelsea to Aston Villa. Now, he will be competing with
          Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi for the starting spot. If he
          succeeds in finding his place in the squad, Abraham could become one
          of the top scoring forwards this season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Che Adams (owned by 1.3%, 6.0) &ndash;</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Southampton new signing, Che Adams, could be a critical part of their
          squad this season. With 2 goals already in pre-season, Adams is off to
          a hot start in his Southampton career. In the Championship with
          Birmingham last season, Adams managed 22 goals and 4 assists and will
          be looking to carry that momentum into the Premier League. Adams is
          perhaps the best option at 6.0 and under.
