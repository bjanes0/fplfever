          Many fantasy managers this season will be looking to pick up at least
          two premium defenders such as&nbsp;<strong
            >Andrew Robertson (7.0), Trent Alexander-Arnold (7.0) or Aymeric
            Laporte (6.5),&nbsp;</strong
          >but will be left with 1 or 2 extra slots for an additional defender.
          Here are 5 options that can help you get ahead early this season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kyle Walker (6.0)&nbsp;</strong>leads off the list. Priced at
          6.0, he looks like a top option due to his price reduction and
          consistent minutes. Although few players in Pep's lineups are safe
          from rotation, Walker should be starting most matches with the
          occasional rotation with <strong>Danilo (5.0).&nbsp;</strong>In
          addition to his consistent minutes, Walker picked up only 1 goal and 1
          assist last season, compared to 12 assists in the 2 seasons before. If
          he can pick up his offensive numbers, Walker could finish in the top 5
          point scorers for defenders this season. Selected by 15.7%, Walker
          could return big points early on as he faces a number of offensively
          weak sides in his first 10 matches of the season such as Norwich and
          Brighton.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another City man,&nbsp;<strong>Oleksander Zinchenko (5.5)</strong>
          could make his mark in FPL this season. As the budget City defensive
          option and in just 5.7% of teams, Zinchenko could provide a budget
          option into the City defense. At the end of last season, Zinchenko
          solidified his spot in the title-winning Manchester City side,
          starting 11 of the final 12 matches of the season. In those games, he
          kept 9 clean sheets, conceding just twice. In addition, he managed 3
          assists, proving his ability to attack. In addition, new
          signing&nbsp;<strong>Angelino (5.0)&nbsp;</strong>failed to impress in
          pre-season and&nbsp;<strong>Benjamin Mendy (6.0)</strong> looks to
          miss out on the opening weeks due to injury. Overall, Zinchenko's
          starting spot should be sealed for the start of the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everton man&nbsp;<strong>Seamus Coleman (5.5)</strong> will be keen on
          carrying his run of good form from last season into this one. Coleman
          kept 6 clean sheets in his final 7 games of the season and was able to
          find his place in the Everton attack once again, as he scored twice
          and assisted on two other occasions. Everton proved their return to
          being a Premier League powerhouse with victories and clean sheets
          against Manchester United, Chelsea, and Arsenal at the end of last
          season. With just 3.8% of players owning the Irishman, he seems a good
          option for anyone looking to make a small downgrade from a 6.0
          defender to a slightly cheaper one.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Another wing-back,&nbsp;<strong>Ben Chilwell (5.5)</strong>, is
          another differential option at just 6.0% ownership. Chilwell proved
          his attacking potential last season after finding 5 assists, and has
          been priced under teammate&nbsp;<strong>Ricardo Pereira (6.0)</strong
          >. Chilwell could certainly build on his points tally of 118 last
          season. Leicester proved their defensive capabilities last year as
          they had the 5<sup>th</sup> best xGA in the league and the 7<sup
            >th</sup
          >
          least goals conceded. With a few tricky fixtures at the start of the
          season, it could be difficult for Chilwell to get off to a good start,
          but he could certainly be a solid option throughout the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, a bit of a wildcard option is
          <strong>Max Aarons (4.5) </strong>of newly promoted Norwich City.
          Aarons was one of the most attacking wing-backs in the Championship
          last season after picking up 2 goals and 6 assists, and being
          consistently involved in the attack. At an appropriate price point,
          Aarons could make up for Norwich&rsquo;s potential trouble with
          attacking returns, due to the high value of attacking defenders in
          FPL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, many solid defensive options are yet to be picked up by
          managers and could give your team a competitive edge. My pick to
          perform the best is Zinchenko, but I&rsquo;m excited to see what this
          season holds for defensive players. &nbsp;
