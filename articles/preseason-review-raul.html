        <p>
          After a robust season 2018/19 season, Raul Jiminez was one of the top
          picks for many fantasy managers due to his low price and explosive FPL
          returns. After scoring nearly 200 points last year, with 181, he is
          undoubtably on everyone's radar once again.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Preseason Review</strong></p>
        <p>
          Jiminez had a preseason filled with action for his country and has a
          few upcoming matches with Wolves in preseason. He played with Mexico
          in the CONCACAF gold cup and was able to find the net 4 times in 7
          matches. Upcoming, he has 3 more matches with Wolves as they attempt
          to qualify for the Europa League. If he continues his form from the
          gold cup, he could manage to get off to a hot start this season.
          Overall, his preseason form has been excellent.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Initial Fixtures</strong></p>
        <p>
          At the start of the season, Wolves will face strong opposition with
          matches against Leicester, Manchester United, and Chelsea in their
          first 5. Despite this, Wolves have proven their capability to take
          down big teams in the past, which means Jiminez could still find
          points early on. Jiminez also has the bonus of rotating penalties with
          teammate Ruben Neves, and with the next one being Raul&rsquo;s
          responsibility, he could help managers get off the ground in the new
          season.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Overall Verdict</strong></p>
        <p>
          All things considered, Jiminez should be set for another season as a
          great fantasy option. His 7.5 price tag isn&rsquo;t too demanding for
          most managers and provides good value for the quality he offers.
